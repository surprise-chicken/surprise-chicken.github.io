							<p>Dear My Sidney,</p>
							<p>Remember when you woke up to balloons, flowers, and cakes<br>
								After that one blurry, post-painting and dancing birthday night?<br>
								How crazy is it that it's been 4 years since then?<br>
								So many things have changed but you have always stayed the same. 
								You've always been as grateful, as kind, as loving, and as good of a friend day 1 and today.</p>

							<p>For us two, it's been 4 years, 3 vacations, 2 homes, and 1 business that we shared together.<br>
								And my biggest realization through it all, is I really don't know what I would do without you, my girl wonder <3.<br>
								Your friendship is the part of adulthood that I never saw coming but needed the most.<br>
								If I could talk to anxious Janice who is starting college at 19, I would tell her not to worry because<br>
								She'll meet the most amazing girl who'll weather all the storm with her; I would tell her to ease up,<br>
								because college will bring her to her Sidney, her rock, and her home;<br>
								I would tell her to be excited because all her good days will have Sidney written all over them.<br>
								Thank you Sid for being the best friend that you are, for your steady companionship, your candor,<br>
								Your humor, your BIG BIG heart, and for always making room for me and our friendship.</p>

							<p>For this birthday, I pray that you get all the love I know you deserve.<br>
								I pray that as you grow older, the people who walk in your life makes you at peace and happyâ€”the way you make us gorls feel.<br>
								I pray that when you doubt and wonder, you are reminded of all the good that makes you, you.<br>
								I pray that you never forget, no matter proximity or time, our friendship will always be the same.<br>
								Happiest Birthday best friend, I love and miss you so so much!</p>

							<p>Always,</br>
								Your Jaknees</p>
							</p>

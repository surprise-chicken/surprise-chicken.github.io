							<p>Happy birthday, badutku sayangku! As per what-it-seems-to-now-be-a-tradition, I’ve made you a website, though I’ve taken a different approach this year and invited your friends to write messages to you. I hope that this year’s website conveys a clear message: that you are loved and that you are truly a blessing to others.</p>
							<p>“Why do you like Sidney?” Remember that that was the question I’d fear the most when I met your family. It wasn’t that I lacked things that I liked about you, but rather the opposite: it’s impossible to condense all that I liked into a few sentences.</p>
							<p>I’ve thought about the question more deeply recently, and here’s my attempt at it: “I like Sidney because I admire her. I admire her intelligence, her competency, and most of all her perseverance. She’s someone who will never give up on something she sets her heart towards, and moreover will go the extra mile, giving her best 110%. At the same time, Sidney is, how to put this lightly, weird and quirky in the best way possible. She has an original humor that never fails to make me laugh, even unintentionally. Her weird energy complements my own, and I couldn’t ask for a better synergy.”</p>
							<p>I’m grateful that you’ve crashed into my life. I love your silliness and your clownliness, your quirky habits and your weirdness. They say that smiling and laughing causes more wrinkles later on when you get older, so I have you to blame for that. Though I’ll be a lucky man to enjoy each passing day with you till our many wrinkles form.</p>

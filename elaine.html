							<p>Hi CHICKENNNNNN!!! 🧸🧸Happy BDAYYY BABY!! U finally 22 heheheheheh!!! ❤️A year older than me :((( BB I miss u smmm hope u have an amazing bday in Indo like always !! You are an amazing person who is always selfless, caring, and beautiful inside and out. 💕💕But don’t forget your credit card next time ya! You have always been there for me and I consider you as one of my closest friends! 👯‍♀️I remember when we met for the first time in Vong with you know who. Looking back at it, I can’t believe how much has changed but your passion and kindness have never changed and I love you for it! Let’s make more memo together! 😍From being Babson Freshies to now being in your last semester of college, I am confident that anything that you will do from now on will be filled with success and happiness! 🥰I am amazed how when you travel with your family to Japan, you still think of your friends and that shows how genuine you are. 💖Those who are close to you would be so lucky to have you as a friend and I feel like I’m so lucky to have met you in Babson hehe. 💓But distance doesn’t matter right? If you need anything, remember, I am only one call away. I can’t wait to grow old with you and meet your children in the future hehe. 👧Wish you all the best and success and everything amazing the world has to offer to you. 🤍🤍🤍</p>

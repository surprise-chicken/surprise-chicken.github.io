							<p>Hi Sidbae, Happiest 22nd birthday ❤️ I cant believe it’s been almost 8 years since we’ve known each other but i’m so grateful for the fact that it feels like we’ve known each other our whole lives 🥺🫶 I feel like at this point, no words or letters could ever truly describe how lucky others and I are to have you born into this world today — you’re literally the most genuinely beautiful human being inside and out that i’ve ever met. You were born with the kindest soul, funniest spirit, and most generous heart. Im so lucky to call you my best friend and there is no one else who i’d rather share 3am fatigue-filled laughing fits, daily sleepovers, and midnight meals with. </p>
							<p>At 22, I’m so happy and proud to see everything you’ve accomplished — especially when i get a behind the scenes of not only the highlights but your journey there. I love seeing you get so engrossed in what fuels you from paintbar to google and im SO EXCITED TO see whats next for you!!! But besides just your career accomplishments that i know motivates you to grow, I hope you also take time to appreciate all the other things no one but you could ever do. From creating a whole 40 page doc for interviews, memorizing an entire chinese business pitch, to your magical ability of motivating people to believe that they can do anything — you never fail to showcase how you’re a force in this world. You’re also honestly such a blessing for those around you because of how much you care and are willing to give. You have the SOFTEST and ga tegaan heart, girl u r like a sanrio character man but with the quirkiness of an anime character 😚</p>
							<p>Sidney, i am so so damn grateful to have you in my life and i cannot thank you enough for being the best friend anyone could ever wish for 🫶🥹 tearing up reading this because i cant ever imagine a life without you — legit reminds me of how sad i felt when i saw u after clubbing (yang u gapergi ke HAN, terus i liat u masuk kamar i, i inget kt mau graduate trs i full on cry). Love you even if our situation ever involves mushroom, 98% alcohol, or socks 🤡</p>
							<p>I could never thank Babson enough for putting us into Forest aka the HOOD (even though u cried when we first heard) and making us forever roommates and sisters.👯‍♀️ I hope that this new age will only bring you more endless joy and blessings to come as all your wishes come true!! Super sad that i wont be able to wish you happy birthday in real life, but i cant wait to see you soon again back home in boston 🥰🥰 love you for life sistur, have a blast with your loved ones in indo!! HAPPIEST 22ND BIRTHDAY GIRL, GO PARTYY IT UP HUNNI ❤️</p>
